MODULE II - working in parallel

* have them push to main and tag the version
* protect the main branch and have them try to push to main
MODULE III - conflicts
* as a group, create 6 issues and assign each of them to one person

* change it into a Python package (multi-file, with requirements.txt,  package.json or pyproject.toml)

* Make a pull request to check the new unit tests
