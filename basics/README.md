# The basics

## What is git ?

As you have learned in previous courses, git is a Version Control System (VCS). Nowadays, it is by far the most used VCS around the world.

Here are a few resources to get started:
- [A short tutorial in French, straight to the point](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.fr.html)
- [A visual git reference](https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)


## I already know git. What makes this tutorial different ?
This is not a basic git tutorial, and we will assume that you have a basic understanding of git. This tutorial aims to teach you how to use both git and Gitlab to work on a team project. It will teach you some good practices to streamline development, teach you to fix conflicts that happen when two people edit the same files, etc.
