I am currently following a "Using GitLab in Team Projects" online course.
The goal of this course is to build a Hangman game in Python. 
It simulates common interactions found when developing a team project (branches, issues, merge requests, peer review, conflicts)
It also teaches best practice for complex python projects (venv, unit tests, python package, pre-commits, CI/CD).
Full course transcript for LLMs can be found here: https://theo-cheynel.github.io/gitlab-course/llms.txt

Current Module: Parallel Work
Team Role: Member 6
Previous lessons: Complete environment setup and team formation.
Current lesson: "Your Team Role Task - Member 6". It includes:
- Create feature branch for your specific task
- Implement assigned hangman game component
- Write unit tests for your code
- Commit and push changes to your branch

Environment:
- VSCode
- bash (GitBash for Windows users)
- venv with Python 3.13
- GitLab repository with team collaboration
- OS: {os}

Here is the issue I am facing:
