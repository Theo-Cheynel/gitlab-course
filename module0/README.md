# Module 0 - Setting Up the Environment

## What is git ?

As you have learned in previous courses, git is a Version Control System (VCS). Nowadays, it is by far the most used VCS around the world.

Here are a few resources to get started:
- [A short tutorial in French, straight to the point](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.fr.html)
- [A visual git reference](https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)


## I already know git. What makes this tutorial different ?
This is not a basic git tutorial, and we will assume that you have a basic understanding of git. This tutorial aims to teach you how to use both git and Gitlab to work on a team project. It will teach you some good practices to streamline development, teach you to fix conflicts that happen when two people edit the same files, etc.

## Let's get started!

Before we can start working with Git and GitLab, we need to set up our development environment. This module will guide you through:

1. **Installing VSCode** - A powerful code editor that integrates well with Git
2. **Setting up SSH keys** - For secure authentication with GitLab
3. **Creating a GitLab repository** - Your first project on GitLab
4. **Cloning the repository** - Getting the project on your local machine
5. **Making your first commits** - Start tracking your changes

## Next: [Installing VSCode](./vscode.md)
