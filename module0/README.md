## What is Git?

As you have learned in previous courses, Git is a Version Control System (VCS). It's now the most widely used VCS in software development worldwide.

### Quick Git References

- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) - Official Git documentation

## Why This Course is Different

This is **not** a basic Git tutorial. We assume you understand basic Git concepts (commits, branches, repositories). Instead, this course focuses on:

- **Team collaboration** with Git and GitLab
- **Professional workflows** used in real software projects
- **Conflict resolution** when multiple people edit the same files
- **Code review processes** and quality control
- **Automated testing** and deployment pipelines

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this module, you will have:
- ✅ A properly configured development environment
- ✅ Secure SSH authentication with GitLab
- ✅ Your own GitLab repository
- ✅ Local copy of the repository on your machine
- ✅ Understanding of the basic Git workflow

## Important Notes

- **Individual setup**: Everyone completes this module on their own
- **Team formation**: You'll invite teammates in Module 1
- **Follow the order**: Each lesson builds on the previous one
- **Ask for help**: If you get stuck, check troubleshooting sections first
