I am currently following a "Using GitLab in Team Projects" online course.
The goal of this course is to build a Hangman game in Python. 
It simulates common interactions found when developing a team project (branches, issues, merge requests, peer review, conflicts)
It also teaches best practice for complex python projects (venv, unit tests, python package, pre-commits, CI/CD).
Full course transcript for LLMs can be found here: https://theo-cheynel.github.io/gitlab-course/llms.txt

Current Module: Environment Setup
Team Role: {role}
Previous lessons: Installing VSCode, GitBash (if on Windows), Setting up SSH keys, Creating Repository, and Cloning Repository.
Current lesson: "First Commits". It includes:

- Use git commit to save changes
- Use git push to upload to GitLab

Environment:

- bash (GitBash for Windows users)
