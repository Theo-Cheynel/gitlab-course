I am currently following a "Using GitLab in Team Projects" online course.
The goal of this course is to build a Hangman game in Python. 
It simulates common interactions found when developing a team project (branches, issues, merge requests, peer review, conflicts)
It also teaches best practice for complex python projects (venv, unit tests, python package, pre-commits, CI/CD).
Full course transcript for LLMs can be found here: https://theo-cheynel.github.io/gitlab-course/llms.txt

Current Module: Environment Setup
Team Role: {role}
Previous lessons: Installing VSCode, GitBash (if on Windows), and Setting up SSH keys.
Current lesson: "Creating Repository". It includes:
- If Team Member A: Create GitLab project, configure settings, add team members, and take a first look at the interface
- If Team Members B-F: Wait for Team Member A to complete setup, and take a first look at the interface
What can happen in this lesson, is that some students did not sign up on the same gitlab sever (there might be several gitlab servers in place to split the load). They need to all be logged into the same one to be able to collaborate.

Environment:
- VSCode
- bash (GitBash for Windows users)
- venv with Python 3.13
- OS: {os}

Here is the issue I am facing:
