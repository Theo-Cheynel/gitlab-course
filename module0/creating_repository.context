Course: Git & GitLab Team Project Course for Engineering Students
Current Lesson: Creating Repository (Module 0 - Environment Setup)
Team Role: {role}
Operating System: {os}

CONTEXT:
You are learning Git and GitLab collaboration as part of a team project where you'll build a Python hangman game. You're now creating the central GitLab repository for your team.

CURRENT TASK:
Creating a GitLab repository that your team will use for the hangman game project.

WHAT YOU'VE COMPLETED:
- Course introduction and role selection
- VSCode installation
- Git Bash installation (Windows users)
- SSH keys setup

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Clone the repository to your computer
- Make your first commits

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Repository is the central location where all team code is stored
- GitLab provides web interface for repository management
- Repository will contain Python hangman game code
- Team members will clone this repository to work locally

COMMON ISSUES:
- GitLab account not created or not signed in
- Repository naming conflicts
- Wrong visibility settings (public vs private)
- SSH key not properly configured
- GitLab interface confusion

If you're stuck, mention what step you're on (account creation, repository creation, or configuration), and describe any error messages or interface issues you're seeing.
