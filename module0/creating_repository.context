I am currently following a "Using GitLab in Team Projects" online course.
The goal of this course is to build a Hangman game in Python. 
It simulates common interactions found when developing a team project (branches, issues, merge requests, peer review, conflicts)
It also teaches best practice for complex python projects (venv, unit tests, python package, pre-commits, CI/CD).
Full course transcript for LLMs can be found here: https://theo-cheynel.github.io/gitlab-course/llms.txt

Current Module: Environment Setup
Team Role: {role}
Previous lessons: Installing VSCode, GitBash (if on Windows), and Setting up SSH keys.
Current lesson: "Creating Repository". It includes:
- Create GitLab account (if needed)
- Create new project/repository on GitLab
- Configure repository settings (visibility, README)
- Understand repository structure and interface

Environment:
- VSCode
- bash (GitBash for Windows users)
- GitLab account with SSH keys configured
