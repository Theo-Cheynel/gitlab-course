## Creating the GitLab Repository

**You are Team Member A** - You are responsible for creating the GitLab repository that your team will use for the hangman project.

### Step 1: Create New Project

1. Go to your GitLab server (your instructor will provide the URL)
2. Sign in with your account
3. Look for the **"New Project"** button and click it
4. Select **"Create blank project"**

### Step 2: Configure Project Settings

1. **Project name**: Enter a descriptive name like `hangman-team-[your-team-number]`
2. **Visibility Level**: Set to **Private** (only team members can see it)
3. **Initialize repository**: Check the box for **"Initialize repository with a README"**
4. Click **"Create project"**

### Step 3: Add Your Team Members

1. In your new repository, go to **"Project information > Members"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Invite members"**
3. Add each of your team members (B, C, D, E, F) with the following details:
   - **Role**: Select **"Maintainer"** (gives full access to the repository)
   - **Username/Email**: Enter their GitLab username or email address
4. Click **"Invite"** for each member

### Step 4: Verify Team Access

1. Check that all team members appear in the Members list
2. Share the repository URL with your team
3. Ask each team member to confirm they can access the repository

### Step 5: Repository Overview

Your GitLab repository interface contains:

- **Left sidebar**: Navigation menu with Project, Issues, Merge requests, etc.
- **Main area**: File listing (currently just README.md)
- **README.md**: Project description file (displayed below the file list)

### What's Next

Once the repository is created and all team members have access:
1. Each team member will clone the repository to their computer
2. You'll all learn to make commits and work with branches
3. The repository will become the central hub for your hangman game development

**Important**: Keep the repository URL handy - your team will need it for cloning in the next lesson.
