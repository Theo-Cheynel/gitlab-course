## For Windows Users Only

**Linux and macOS users**: You can **skip this section** as you already have a built-in terminal with Git support. Proceed directly to the next lesson.

**Windows users**: You need Git Bash to follow along with this course effectively.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download Git for Windows

1. Go to [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. The download should start automatically
3. If it doesn't start, click **"Click here to download manually"**

### Step 2: Run the Installer

1. **Run the downloaded `.exe` file** (you may need administrator privileges)
2. **Click "Yes"** when Windows asks for permission
3. Use the default settings throughout the installation
4. Click **"Install"** and wait for the installation to complete
5. Click **"Finish"**

## Running Git Bash

1. Click the **Start button**
2. Type **"Git Bash"**
3. Click on **Git Bash** when it appears

Once Git Bash is open, test these commands:

```bash
git --version
```
Should show something like: `git version 2.x.x.windows.x`
