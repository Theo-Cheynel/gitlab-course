Course: Git & GitLab Team Project Course for Engineering Students
Current Lesson: Setting up SSH Keys (Module 0 - Environment Setup)  
Team Role: {role}
Operating System: {os}

CONTEXT:
You are learning Git and GitLab collaboration as part of a team project where you'll build a Python hangman game. SSH keys provide secure authentication with GitLab.

CURRENT TASK:
Setting up SSH keys for GitLab - creating a secure "password" that your computer and GitLab share.

WHAT YOU'VE COMPLETED:
- Course introduction and role selection
- VSCode installation
- Git Bash installation (Windows users)

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Create GitLab repository
- Clone repository to your computer

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- SSH keys consist of a private key (stays on your computer) and public key (shared with GitLab)
- Ed25519 keys are recommended over RSA
- Public key ends with .pub extension
- Private key has no extension and must be kept secret

COMMON ISSUES:
- "ssh-keygen: command not found" - missing Git/OpenSSH installation
- "Permission denied (publickey)" - wrong key uploaded or GitLab configuration issue
- Copying private key instead of public key (.pub file)
- Key already exists error - can use existing key or delete and recreate

If you're stuck, mention your operating system, which step you're on (checking existing keys, generating new keys, copying public key, adding to GitLab, or testing connection), and any specific error messages.
