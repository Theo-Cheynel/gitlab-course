I am currently following a "Using GitLab in Team Projects" online course.
The goal of this course is to build a Hangman game in Python. 
It simulates common interactions found when developing a team project (branches, issues, merge requests, peer review, conflicts)
It also teaches best practice for complex python projects (venv, unit tests, python package, pre-commits, CI/CD).
Full course transcript for LLMs can be found here: https://theo-cheynel.github.io/gitlab-course/llms.txt

Current Module: Team Setup
Team Role: {role}
Previous lessons: installing VSCode and GitBash (if on Windows).
Current lesson: "Setting up SSH keys". It includes:
- Check if you already have SSH keys
- Generate new SSH keys
- Copy your public key
- Add the key to GitLab
- Test your SSH connection

Environment:
- VSCode
- bash (GitBash for Windows users)
- venv with Python 3.13
