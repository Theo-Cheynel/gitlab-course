I am currently following a "Using GitLab in Team Projects" online course.
The goal of this course is to build a Hangman game in Python. 
It simulates common interactions found when developing a team project (branches, issues, merge requests, peer review, conflicts)
It also teaches best practice for complex python projects (venv, unit tests, python package, pre-commits, CI/CD).
Full course transcript for LLMs can be found here: https://theo-cheynel.github.io/gitlab-course/llms.txt

Current Module: Environment Setup
Team Role: {role}
Previous lessons: Installing VSCode, GitBash (if on Windows), Setting up SSH keys, Creating Repository, and Cloning Repository.
Current lesson: "Setting up Python Virtual Environment". It includes:
- Create virtual environment using python -m venv
- Activate virtual environment (different commands for Windows vs macOS/Linux)
- Configure VSCode to use the virtual environment
- Create .gitignore to exclude venv folder
- Understanding requirements.txt for dependency management

Environment:
- VSCode
- bash (GitBash for Windows users)
- Local repository cloned from GitLab
- Python 3.13 (system installation)
- venv (Python virtual environment)
- OS: {os}

Here is the issue I am facing:
