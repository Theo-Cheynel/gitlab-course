## Setting up Python Virtual Environment

A **virtual environment** is an isolated Python environment that keeps your project's dependencies separate from your system Python installation. This prevents conflicts between different projects and ensures everyone on your team uses the same Python packages.

### Step 1: Create Virtual Environment

From inside yout project directory, run the following command to create a new virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This creates a folder called `venv` containing your isolated Python environment.

### Step 2: Activate Virtual Environment

Windows (Git Bash):
```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Success indicator**: Your terminal prompt should now show `(venv)` at the beginning:
```
(venv) user@computer:~/hangman-repository$
```

### Step 3: Verify Virtual Environment

Check that you're using the python binaries located inside the virtual environment:

```bash
which python
```

Should show a path containing your project directory and `venv`.

### Step 5: Upgrade pip

Update pip to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```


## Daily Workflow

### Working from a terminal

Do this **every time you work on this project:**

1. Navigate to your repository directory
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `source venv/Scripts/activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Work on your project
4. When done, deactivate if needed: `deactivate`

### Working with VSCode

1. Open VSCode in your repository directory:

```bash
code .
```

2. VSCode should automatically detect your virtual environment
3. If not, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "Python: Select Interpreter"
4. Choose the interpreter from your `venv` folder

## Troubleshooting

#### Virtual environment not activating on Windows
- Make sure you're using Git Bash, not Command Prompt
- Try: `venv/Scripts/activate` instead of `source venv/Scripts/activate`

#### "python: command not found"
- Check Python installation: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
- Use `python3` instead of `python` if needed

#### VSCode not recognizing virtual environment
- Restart VSCode after creating the virtual environment
- Manually select interpreter: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Python: Select Interpreter"

**Remember**: Always activate your virtual environment before working on the project!
