I am currently following a "Using GitLab in Team Projects" online course.
The goal of this course is to build a Hangman game in Python. 
It simulates common interactions found when developing a team project (branches, issues, merge requests, peer review, conflicts)
It also teaches best practice for complex python projects (venv, unit tests, python package, pre-commits, CI/CD).
Full course transcript for LLMs can be found here: https://theo-cheynel.github.io/gitlab-course/llms.txt
